AEIS
---

Tools for analyzing data from the **Academic Excellence Indicator System** and the **Texas Academic Performance Report**.


### How to Use

To scrape and download all data from AEIS:

    $ python -m aeis.scrape data

To analyze the columns of the downloaded data:

    $ python -m aeis.analyzers data


### Next Steps

We still need to scrape and analyze the 2013 academic indicators,
but those have moved to a new system: the Texas Academic Performance Report.

The 2012-2013 data can be downloaded from this page:
